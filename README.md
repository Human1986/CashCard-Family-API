In this beginner course, I learned how to build a complete REST API from start to finish with Spring Boot. 
With interactive labs on Spring Academy by VMware, I got hands-on practice every step of the way — bootstrapping with Spring Initializr, through authenticating & authorizing with Spring Security.

In this course, I built a Family Cash Card service—an app for families to manage allowances in the form of digital debit cards. 
By building this service from start to finish, I learned about REST APIs, Spring Security, data persistence, metrics, and modern application development.

MODULE 1
